# RFID_NFC_TAG_9x6
RFID TAGs (PCB and datasheets)

A simple small 9x6 mm PCB which uses two additional components to make up an RFID tag.
Schematic KiCad files are included along with the GERBER files ready to send to a fab house for building.

It is reccomended to have these panelized as a 10 x 12 array ( 120 tags per PCB) 
With the minimum order of 5 PCBs this will get 600 tags.

These are intended for use on model railways but applicable to other things.

Designed for 13.56 MHz
    Uses an NXP SL2S2602FTBX three pin IC (very small)
    And a 43pF capacitor for antanna matching ( 0402 SMD = very small )

Experience with surface mount component assembly is recommended (hot plate method). 

For a complete RFID solution a tag needs a reader to get information from it.
