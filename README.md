# RFID_NFC_TAG_9x6
RFID TAGs (PCB and datasheets)

A simple small 9x6 mm PCB which uses two additional components to make up an RFID tag.
Intended for use on model railways but applicable to other things.

Designed for 13.56 MHz
    Uses an NXP SL2S2602FTBX three pin IC
    And a 43pF capacitor for antanna matching ( 0402 SMD = very small )

  For a complete solution a tag needs a reader to get information from it.
