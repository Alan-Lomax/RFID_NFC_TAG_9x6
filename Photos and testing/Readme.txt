PCB's arrived and were unboxed around 11 am

Solder paste was chosen with a indicated melt of 183 Deg C
A small dab was placed in the lid and mixed with a drop of IPA to make it smooth and creamy (was slightly grainy)
Used a solder aid tool to transfer miniscule dabs onto the solder pads. 
   For capacitor this was practical. 
   For RFID chip the triad of pins were too close together and typically one blob covered all three.
With very fine tweezers parts were placed on the paste. Each chip was verified for orientation (third pin is a tell tale)
Parts were only removed from packaging 4 at a time and only once placed were 4 more taken out of tape package.
The PCB with two complete rows was carefully put on the hot plate for a pre soak at 100 Deg C (5 minutes)
Temp was raised in stages with a short hold period at each (145 C, 190 C and then finally up to 205 C)
At 145 the IPA was obviously driven off, at 190 some melt was occuring (but not the majority)
At 205C melt was occuring in most places and this temperature was held for 10 minutes.
It was noticed that one IC had popped up in the air 90 degrees to board.
A close inspection then showed that capacitor on Tag 1 was MIA. A new one was retrieved from package and put in place
Hot plate was switched off and allowed to cool down. 
The PCB was removed from the hot plate (which was warm but not hot at this stage)

Using the Starfishrail test rig that I have I was able to test these tags for a simple go/no-go functionality test.
Of the 24 tags only 4 failed.  (Awesome result in my opinion)

The 4 failed tags will be inspected for obvious issues
The Working tags will be ssanned for their UID
