I have tidied up the board (previously had no marking, Now R1a)
- slightly larger pads for easier home soldering
- tighter and more regular coil spacing
- shrink dimensions a fraction of a mm
- added registration marks in the corners
- panelized to 10x15 array with rails on left and right for automated assembly process 


Exploring JLCPCB assembly. Yes they can do it.
In Kicad use the JLCPCB fabrication toolkit to export the files (Gerbers, drill files, BOM and position files)
Note: the tag has some footprints that are not real devices - like the net joiner and some of the oversize copper pads. 
These may need to be manually deleted from position files as there is nothing in the BoM for them as expected.

For caps they have many thousands in stock.
The total cost of the capacitors is under $1.50 !

For the NXP RFID chips they only have 5 on hand and I would need to order them in (Which is not a problem really.) 
My R1a PCB would take 150, times 5 PCB = 750 chips in total.
Ordering this many gets a unit price of 0.5575 is Still ~$420

Best guess all in cost is ~$500 for 750 tags
